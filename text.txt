The open function creates and returns a new file descriptor for the file named
 by filename. Initially, the file position indicator for the file is at the
 beginning of the file. The argument mode (see Permission Bits) is used only
 when a file is created, but it doesnâ€™t hurt to supply the argument in any case.
